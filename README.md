[Angular CLI v21.0.2](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

This is a recreation of an old school project that I made for practice using Angular.

Compared to the [Original](https://jakeebro.github.io/Taniti/), this one is built as a single page application and features a responsive UI, as well as a fake purchasing backend using a Firestore database.
